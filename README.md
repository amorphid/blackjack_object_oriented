## Style Guide
1.  Everything goes in a class.
2.  If a class had more than 6 methods, including the initialize method, try
breaking it into two methods.
3.  If a method has more than 5 lines, break it's probably too big.
4.  If you have arrays within arrays, you're probably missing an array.

## Philosophy
1.  The only way to write good code is to have written lots of bad code.
2.  Ask any experienced developer how often they screw up.  They'll probably say
pretty much all the time.
3.  Learn how to test.  The longer you wait, the harder it becomes.
